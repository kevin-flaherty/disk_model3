# disk_model

This code generates model images of gas or dust from protoplanetary/debris disks. Developed at Wesleyan University, but based heavily on a code-base originally writted by Katherine Rosenfeld.

See Guide.txt or the ipython notebook Guide.pynb for information on how to use this code.

### Unlike disk_model, this version is intended to run under python3. disk_model is designed for python2.7
